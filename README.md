# LNOEO
An online version of the board game Last Night on Earth


Project Log

Week of 11/9
I have decided that I am going to code the game in c++.
I have started creating objects for the game such as the grid and 
placeholder cards without effects.

Week of 11/16
I have continued work on the game objects.  I have created players. 
I have not started on a game loop so nothing currently happens.  I also need
to work on the randomization of board pieces and creating the grid appropriately, currently
the grid is basic and does not quite look like the grid for LNOE.

Week of 11/23 and Thanksgiving break
I plan on finishing the game objects necessary for the game.  Then I can focus on 
the game logic soon.  For this week however, I plan to download raknet and go through
online tutorials on how to use it.  I hope be able to use it to create a simple game
of tictactoe to understand how to integrate it with LNOE.
